# Armand Francois | Carlos Quiroz | Gerald Watts III

## OVERVIEW
This project is an analysis of all the meteorites recorded falling through the Earth's Atomsphere. 

## MAIN OBJECTIVES
Our main focus was pointed towards the following questions:

- Which areas in the world had the most concentration of meteorites?
- How many meteorites fell each year and what was the average mass of a meterorite?
- What was the market price for meteorites? How are they priced by weight(grams)?

## DATA
The data for this project was found in a CSV dataset located in https://data.world/nasa/meteorite-landings. This dataset contained over 45,000 entries which was converted into a database using SQL. Data utilized in the query includes the mass, year that it fell or was found, and the geographical location using the latitude and longitude.
